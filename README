#sender_id is already taken, which is ghetto. make sender polymorphic and let them decide
#make a generator
#make recipients polymorphic
#automatically make the email_user and association tables
#path to default erb template is ghetto

# I automatically make a template_variable for every attribute of the table, but if you forget and have
  `foo` as an attribute on your class along with `template_variable :foo` in your AM object then
  the object will mysteriously refuse to set the attribute.

# global to, cc, bcc feature
# send! should set errors not throw exceptions

#make logging easier

#can end up with duplicates in template_variable (and maybe mailer_variable); possibly caused by
 using reload! in console. Have to explciitly use template_variable(?)

# template variables aren't implemented yet. it just makes the accessor and doesn't provide it to the email

# rendered_contents contains what was actually sent
